  <p>The IT Industry today has become extremely competitive. It is imperative for each organization to
keep their employees up-to- date on their technical skills in order to remain abreast with the huge
inflow of customer demands. With the need for companies to diversify into newer technologies,
it is often not possible to play a balancing act between strategic directions a company takes,
and ensuring that the company’s resources understand and technically align themselves to the organization’s
strategic vision. Hence, it becomes imperative that companies choose the right resource competency development
partners that not only exhibit a proven excellence in the relevant echnology, but also, have the right methodologies
to impart that knowledge in order to equip the resources with key skills in terms of technology and the key
    business processes that the technology touches.</p>
